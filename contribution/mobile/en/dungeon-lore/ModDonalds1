>You see it there, nestled between two skyscrapers.
>The building seems extremely out of place, but so easy to overlook.
> It is only 2 stories tall, with a crumbling facade, looking like something from a bygone era.
> It looks like a diner you would see in ancient books about rosy-cheeked women and slick-haired men.
> A large window is broken, but the neon sign is still vivid and flickering, alive.

> " ModDonald's," it reads. 

You walk in, and you see a dimly-lit counter and some booths with peeling seats.
Behind the counter is a bunny-eared person wearing a pink apron. 
"Would you like to hear today's specials? Coffee is half-off until 5am, and we have our FAMOUS 5 or 5,000 ModNuggets deal again! only 1,000,000 BTC!" they chirp happily.

You decide to order the ModNuggets.
The 5,000 deal sounded like a steal, afterall...
Now you just have to find somewhere to put all of them.
The chef, a looming shadowy shape behind a window filled with glowing magenta light, rings a small bell, and the rabbit brings the food to your table. 


"Remember to spit out the pits! They're somewhat poisonous!" they say, then wink at you.
You stare out the window, at someone graffiting the building across the tight alleyway.
"BREAD GANG WAS HERE" it reads. 
You chomp down on a ModNugget and realize too late that you cracked the pit open.
The world grows dim.
