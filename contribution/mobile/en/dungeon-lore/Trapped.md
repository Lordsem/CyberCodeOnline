You've visited these rooms countless times. Maybe not these exact rooms, but over time they all begin to look the same. You feel as if there are no surprises left for you. Kill your opponent and loot their body, hoping you've stocked enough pain away to not be on the other end of the fight.

Once again, you encounter another shadowy figure that seems out to take your tech and your life. The battle goes as expected. Hit, heal, hit, heal, repeat. You're about to execute the killing blow when your opponent lifts up their hand as if they could block your bolt with it. "Please don't. Can't you see we are the same," they say.

Your trigger is already halfway pulled, but then you see their face and slowly release. You thought that what they were saying was merely metaphor, but you find yourself looking directly at your own face. Have you been killing yourself over and over again this whole time? What kind of reality is this?

As you ponder these things, out of the corner of your eye you see your opponent slowly raises their weapon. Reflexively you point and fire a bolt directly into the face that looks just like your own. You scavenge the body and move on, your instinct to survive outweighing the multitude of questions going through your head. You need a good night's sleep.
